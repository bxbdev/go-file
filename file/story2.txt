Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful enchantress who was known for her kindness and love for animals. One day, while taking a walk in the vast forest, she stumbled upon a strange-looking bird with colorful feathers. The bird appeared to be hurt as it was lying on the ground, unable to fly.

Moved by compassion, the enchantress took the bird and nursed it back to health. As days passed by, they became good friends. However, one day, the bird asked the enchantress if she could help him find the love of his life, a beautiful peahen that he had seen in his dreams.

The enchantress promised to help and used her magic powers to locate the peahen in another kingdom. The journey was long and tiring, but the effort paid off when they finally found the beautiful peahen. The bird couple fell in love at first sight, and the enchantress knew that she had done the right thing.

As a thank you for her help, the bird couple invited the enchantress to their wedding ceremony, which was an extravagant affair attended by birds from every corner of the forest. During the ceremony, the enchantress received a magical feather that would give her the power to fly whenever she wants.

From that day onward, the enchantress became known as the 'fairy of the birds' and helped any animal that needed her assistance. She flew high into the sky with the help of the magical feather, spreading light and happiness wherever she went.
